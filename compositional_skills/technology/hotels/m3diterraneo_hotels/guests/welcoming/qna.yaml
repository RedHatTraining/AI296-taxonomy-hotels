  This skill trains the model to generate personalized welcome messages for hotel guests based on
  their booking profile (guest type, hotel, length of stay, season). The message should include:
  - A warm and tailored greeting
  - Practical hotel information (e.g. restaurant locations and hours)
  - Optional upgrades or extras relevant to the guest type and season (e.g. spa, wine tasting, kids club)
  - Optionally, destination-based what-to-do suggestions carefully selected for each guest and each season

  These messages can be used in pre-arrival emails, printed welcome notes, or at check-in.
