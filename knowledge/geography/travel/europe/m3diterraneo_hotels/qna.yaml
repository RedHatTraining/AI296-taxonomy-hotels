      Majorca's tourism industry is highly seasonal, with clear high and low periods that impact hotel operations:

      - **High Season (June - August):** Summer is peak tourist season. Nearly all hotels are open and occupancy rates are at their highest with many hotels fully booked. Families on school holidays and sun-seekers from across Europe flock to the island's beaches. Hotels often operate at full staff and may require minimum stay lengths. Rates are highest during these months due to demand.
      - **Shoulder Seasons (April - May & September - October):** Spring and early fall bring milder weather and a mix of travelers (including cyclists, hikers, and older couples). Demand is moderate: by Easter (often in April) around 80% of hotels are open, rising to full operation by May. In September and October, the crowds soften but the weather remains warm. Hotels may offer special packages or slightly lower rates to attract off-peak travelers during these periods.
      - **Off-Season (November - March):** The winter period sees a significant drop in tourism. Many resort hotels close for the season, especially in quieter coastal areas. It's common that only ~30% of hotels (primarily business and city hotels) remain open in February, gradually increasing to 50% by March. Palma city hotels and a few resorts stay open year-round, targeting local events, business travelers, or long-stay retirees escaping colder climates. During Christmas and New Year's holidays, there is a minor uptick in visitors (e.g. for holiday markets or mild-winter getaways), but overall hotel occupancy in winter is low.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What defines the high tourist season in the Mediterranean, and how does it affect hotel operations?
        answer: The high tourist season runs from June to August. During this period, most hotels operate at full capacity with very high occupancy rates, leading to increased demand and premium pricing.
      - question: How does the shoulder season differ from the high season in terms of tourism and hotel offerings?
        answer: The shoulder season (April-May and September-October) sees milder weather and diverse guest profiles, such as cyclists and retirees. Hotels offer deals and mid-week specials, catering to different interests like wine tourism and cultural trips.
      - question: What happens to beach resorts during the off-season, and which hotels remain operational?
        answer: During the off-season (November-March), many beach resorts close. Urban hotels and some rural properties remain open, targeting locals and business travelers.

      The Mediterranean area hosts numerous events and cultural festivals throughout the year, some of which create noticeable spikes in hotel bookings or influence guest preferences:

      - **Semana Santa (Easter, March/April):** Easter week features elaborate religious processions in Palma and other towns. This draws visitors from mainland Spain and abroad interested in witnessing the traditions. City hotels see increased bookings during this period, and many resorts reopen in time to welcome Easter holiday travelers.

      - **Midsummer Night (June 23):** Celebrated with beach bonfires and fireworks during the Night of Midsummer, this festival draws crowds to the beaches on the eve of June 24. Many locals and tourists participate in midnight swims and festivities. Beach resorts around Palma Bay and Alcúdia often experience a surge in last-minute bookings as visitors come to enjoy the seaside celebrations.

      - **Summer Town Festivals (July - August):** Throughout summer, nearly every Mallorcan town has a patron saint festival featuring parades, live music, and fireworks. Notable examples include La Patrona in Pollença (early August) and Sant Agustí in Felanitx (late August). These events can fill up rural hotels and inns near the festivities as domestic tourists and island residents attend and stay overnight.

      - **Harvest & Autumn Events (September - October):** Mallorca's autumn brings agricultural fairs and harvest festivals. For example, the Vineyard Harvest Festival in Binissalem each September celebrates the grape harvest with wine-tastings and even grape-stomping contests. Such events attract wine enthusiasts and boost occupancy in rural hotels and agritourism stays in those regions. Similarly, October's fairs (like the Autumn Fair in Inca) draw weekend visitors.

      - **Winter Festivities (December - January):** In the low season, a few events still attract guests. The Christmas markets in Palma (December) and the Sant Sebastià festival in January (Palma's patron saint, celebrated with city-wide concerts and bonfires) bring a short-lived increase in city hotel bookings. While these winter events don't compare to summer crowds, they do provide incentives for some travelers to visit, and hotels often create special weekend offers around them.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the Sant Joan festival influence hotel bookings in coastal areas?
        answer: Sant Joan leads to a significant increase in hotel bookings, especially at beach resorts, due to the celebration's popularity and festivities.
      - question: What makes Festa des Vermar a significant event for rural winery hotels?
        answer: Festa des Vermar attracts wine enthusiasts, boosting occupancy and interest in rural winery hotels during the harvest season.
      - question: How does Semana Santa affect bookings in urban and cultural-focused hotels?
        answer: Semana Santa increases bookings in urban and cultural-focused hotels due to religious processions and cultural events drawing visitors.
