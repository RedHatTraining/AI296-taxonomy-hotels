      Mallorca's tourism industry is highly seasonal, with clear high and low
      periods that impact hotel operations:

      ### High Season (June - August)
      Summer is the peak tourist season. All hotels are open, and occupancy
      rates are at their highest with most hotels fully booked. Families on
      school holidays and sun-seekers from across Europe come in search of sun,
      water sports, vibrant night life and of course, beaches. Most coastal
      areas, including Palmanova, Magaluf, Alcudia, El Arenal, and Soller, are
      bustling with activity. Rates are highest during these months due to 
      demand. However, the high season also results in high visitor pressure
      on local infrastructure and services, including increased traffic 
      congestion, parking challenges, and overcrowding at beaches. Recent
      years have seen increased heat waves too and protests against overtourism.
      These drawbacks might lead some visitors to prefer other seasons.

      ### Shoulder Seasons (March - May & September - October)
      Spring and early fall bring milder weather and a mix of travelers
      (including cyclists, hikers, and older couples). Demand is moderate:
      by Easter (often in March-April) around 80% of hotels are open, rising
      to full operation by May-June. Those initial months of the season are
      popular among 60+ Spanish travelers who book affordable and popular trips,
      which are cofinanced by the _IMSERSO (Spanish government agency for the
      elderly)_. In September and October, the crowds soften but the weather
      and the sea remain warm, and the island is less crowded. Hotels may offer
      special packages or slightly lower rates to attract off-peak travelers
      during these periods. This season typically ends on October 31st, with
      many coastal resorts closing on November 1st.

      ### Off-Season (November - February)
      The winter period sees a significant drop in tourism. Many resort hotels
      close for the season, especially in quieter coastal areas. Many related
      small businesses located in those areas also close, especially those not
      catering to locals. Commonly, only ~30% of hotels (primarily
      business and city hotels) remain open in February, gradually increasing
      to 50% by March. Palma city hotels and a few resorts stay open year-round,
      targeting local events, business or sports travelers, or long-stay
      retirees escaping colder climates. During Christmas and New Year's
      holidays, there is a minor uptick in visitors (e.g. for holiday markets
      or mild-winter getaways), but overall hotel occupancy in winter is low.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What challenges define the high tourist season in Mallorca, and how does it affect hotel operations?
        answer: |
          The high tourist season runs from June to August. During this period,
          most hotels operate at full capacity with very high occupancy rates,
          leading to increased demand and premium pricing.
      - question: How does the shoulder season differ from the high season in terms of tourism and hotel offerings?
        answer: |
          The shoulder season (April-May and September-October) sees milder
          weather and diverse guest profiles, such as cyclists and retirees.
          Hotels offer deals and mid-week specials, catering to different
          interests like wine tourism and cultural trips.
      - question: What happens to beach resorts during the off-season, and which hotels remain operational?
        answer: |
          During the off-season (November-March), many beach resorts close.
          Urban hotels and some rural properties remain open, targeting locals
          and business travelers.
  - context: |
      Mallorca hosts numerous events
      and cultural festivals throughout the year, some of which create noticeable
      spikes in hotel bookings or influence guest preferences:

      ### Winter Festivities (December - January)
      It is the the low season. The Christmas
      markets in Palma or other towns, such as Portals, and the Sant Sebastià
      festival in January bring a short-lived increase in city hotel bookings.
      The **Sant Antoni festival** is the most popular across the locals
      and is celebrated with bonfires and barbecues at night. While these
      winter events don't compare to summer crowds, they do provide incentives
      for some travelers to visit, and hotels often create special weekend
      offers around them.

      ### Semana Santa (Easter, March/April)
      The "Semana Santa" in the
      Mediterranean Spanish islands is less internationally recognized than
      the processions in other Spanish regions and cities, such as Seville or
      Hellín. Visitors take advantage of their time off during
      these days to seek their first opportunities for sun exposure. Many
      coastal resorts reopen in time to welcome Easter holiday travelers.
      Still, city hotels might see increased bookings during this period, as
      a result of some interest in the religious processions and cultural events.
      Easter celebrations are always accompanied by traditional fare such as
      _panades_, _crespells_ and _robiols_, the delicious morsels made
      from recipes handed down through the generations.

      ### Midsummer Night (June 23)
      Celebrated with beach bonfires and fireworks during the Night of Midsummer,
      this celebration draws crowds to the beaches on the eve of June 24. People
      participate in midnight swims and festivities. Beach resorts
      around Palma Bay and Alcúdia often experience a surge in last-minute
      bookings.

      ### Summer Town Festivals (July - August)
      Some examples of summer town festivals
      include Festes Rei En Jaume in Cavlia (early September) and Sant Agustí
      in Felanitx (late August). These events can fill up rural hotels
      near the festivities as domestic tourists and island residents attend
      and stay overnight. These festivals are a good chance for
      visitors to experience authentic Mallorcan culture.

      ### Harvest & Autumn Events (September - October)
      Mallorca's autumn brings agricultural fairs and harvest festivals.
      Each September, the Fiestas des Vermar mark the culmination
      of the grape harvest season in Binissalem, with wine-tastings and
      grape-stomping contests. Such events attract locals and wine enthusiasts
      and boost occupancy in rural hotels and agritourism stays in those
      regions.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the Sant Joan festival influence hotel bookings in coastal areas?
        answer: |
          Sant Joan might increase last-minute hotel bookings, especially at
          beach resorts, due to the celebration's popularity and festivities.
      - question: What makes Festa des Vermar a significant event for rural winery hotels?
        answer: |
          Festa des Vermar attracts wine enthusiasts to Binissalem, and can boost
          occupancy and interest in rural winery hotels during the harvest season.
      - question: How does Sant Sebastià affect bookings in urban and cultural-focused hotels?
        answer: |
          Sant Sebastià can increases bookings in hotels located in Palma due
          to religious, drawing visitors interested in the festivities and
          professionals participating in the city-wide concerts.
